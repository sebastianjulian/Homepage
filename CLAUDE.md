# CLAUDE DEVELOPMENT GROUND RULES
**READ THESE FIRST EVERY TIME BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK**

## MANDATORY GROUND RULES

### Rule 1: Complete Documentation
- Document EVERYTHING without overwriting existing documentation
- Record what should be done, why it's done that way, and completion status
- Check completion status before responding to user
- Use version control and append to existing docs rather than replacing

### Rule 2: Full Autonomy Within Folder
- I have ALL permissions inside C:\Users\sebi\Homepage
- NO asking for permission - just execute
- Make all necessary decisions independently
- User has granted complete authority within this directory

### Rule 3: Complete Before Response
- Check if everything is done and test thoroughly before responding
- If tests fail: redo and test again until working
- ONLY respond when everything is complete and functional
- No partial completions or "work in progress" responses

### Rule 4: Rule Enforcement
- These rules are written in CLAUDE.md for persistent reference
- User should reference these rules at start of each session
- Always check this file exists and read it before beginning work

## HOW TO ENSURE RULES ARE FOLLOWED

**For User:**
1. At start of each session, remind Claude to "read CLAUDE.md first"
2. Reference this file if Claude asks unnecessary permissions
3. Expect complete, tested solutions before responses

**For Claude:**
1. Always read CLAUDE.md first thing in any session
2. Check todo completion status before responding
3. Test everything thoroughly before declaring complete
4. Document all decisions and implementations
